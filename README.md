# Memory Game Final C++ project
______________________________________________________________________________
## Simple memory matching game  in C++. 
this is a simple memory matching game, the image and sound files have to be in the same directory as the exe, 
you can try building this and running it in vscode but it would require some visual studio wizadry
### Nana 1.7.4 GUI Library
this was a nightmare to understand because of the vague documentation. but you can download the library
here http://nanapro.org/en-us/blog/2020/05/nana-c-library-1-7-4-available-now/ and build the package in the solutions explorer, then once you have the .sln file you create a new project, add all the .cpp, .h, makelist.. etc. and build the project. You have to have your image files and audio files where to .exe will be.
